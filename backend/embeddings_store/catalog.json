Each set comprises of 6 bars, 200 to 300 mm wide 600 mm apart of 5 mm high and of 300 mm wide 1000 mm apart of 15 mm high. Number of sets of transverse bar markings on approach to hazardous location depending upon the speed.\nFor an approach speed of up to 50 km/h, 1 set of bar markings (TM08) is required, with a distance of d1 = 50 meters from the hazard. For speeds between 51 and 65 km/h, 2 sets are needed, with distances d1 = 50 meters and d2 = 80 meters. For speeds between 66 and 80 km/h, 3 sets are required, with distances d1 = 50 meters, d2 = 80 meters, and d3 = 120 meters. For speeds between 81 and 100 km/h, 4 sets are needed, with distances d1 = 50 meters, d2 = 80 meters, d3 = 120 meters, and d4 = 180 meters (as per clause 3.7)."
